# OpenHAK_Firmware
Latest Firmware release for targeting OpenHAK **beta** hardware.The OpenHAK is built around a Simblee radio module. I know, they don't exist, but we happen to have a small pile and hope to crowdfund a way to get rid of them. 

##Libraries, etc.
This is an Arduino .INO file, and it uses tabs so make sure you have all the tabs

`OpenHAK_Firmware_vX | BLE_Stuff | HeartRate_Stuff | MAX_STuff | OpenHAK.h`

You will also need to ensure that you have the board files for the OpenHAK.
